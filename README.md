## Filonya Productivity Task Stack

A simple browser extension allowing automatic tracking relation
of browser tabs to a specific task using a FILO (First In Last
Out) stack.

Simply press "+" button to create a new task, then start browsing.
When you done with the task, press the colored button to finish the
task. The extension will close all tabs that you opened since
the task creation. You can continue working on the preceding task.
The "X" button clears all tasks WITHOUT closing any tabs.

This is the very first version which I made in a few hours
(including learning on how to write browser extensions).

Some possible improvements:
* Allow labeling tasks
* Allow viewing list of tabs for each task
* Allow dragging tabs to other tasks
* Allow removing from the middle of the list
* Maybe attach current tab to the new task by default
* Maybe init the first task automatically
* Maybe create a settings page with config above
* Error handling

PR's are welcome!

Filonya (филоня) in Russian means "while being lazy" / "taking off" /
"avoiding work".
