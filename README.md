## Filonya Productivity Task Stack

A simple browser extension allowing automatic tracking relation
of browser tabs to a specific task using a FILO (First In Last
Out) stack.

Simply press "+" button to create a new task, then start browsing.
When you done with the task, press the colored button to finish the
task. The extension will close all tabs that you opened since
the task creation. You can continue working on the preceding task.

This is the very first version which I made in a few hours
(including learning on how to write browser extensions).

The possible future improvements:
* Allow labeling tasks
* Maybe attach current tab to the new task by default
* Maybe init the first task automatically
* Allow viewing list of tabs for each task
* Allow dragging tabs to other tasks
* Allow removing from the middle of the list
* Error handling

PR's are welcome!

Filonya (филоня) in Russian means "while being lazy" / "taking off" /
"avoiding work".
